# TODO

## MOVE TODO SECTION TO ISSUE/PROJECT IN GITHUB ONCE UPLOADED

## Main Home Page

- Add more small demos


## Extensions

- Add a native DOM cell template extension (like `@pebula/ngrid-material` but native dom elements), is this needed?
- Build `@pebula/ngrid-bootstrap` based on [https://ng-bootstrap.github.io](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io)?
- `@pebula/ngrid-material`
  - FEAT: finish cell VIEW templates to all types
  - FEAT: Create cell EDIT templates to all types

## Detail Row

- Add "mode" feature (click, double click, cellClick cellDoubleClick, manual)
- See if detail row can work with virtual scroll

## Aggregation

- Support column aggregation / pivot
- By type aggregator
- Custom aggregators

## Scrolling

- Infinite Scrolling (vis virtual scroll)
- Horizontal Virtual Scroll

## Performance

- Refactor column re-ordering logic. Currently re-builds the whole table, need to update viewport only. This is most noticeable when re-ordering and the scroll is deep (e.g. seeing row 300 of 600)
