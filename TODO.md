# TODO

## Detail Row

- Add "mode" feature (click, double click, cellClick cellDoubleClick, manual)

## Aggregation

- Support column aggregation / pivot
- By type aggregator
- Custom aggregators

## Scrolling

- Infinite Scrolling (vis virtual scroll)

## Performance

- Refactor column re-ordering logic. Currently re-builds the whole table, need to update viewport only. This is most noticeable when re-ordering and the scroll is deep (e.g. seeing row 300 of 600)
